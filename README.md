This is a deep learning project built using **Tensorflow** and **Keras**. It reads in a dataset full with images of dogs from different breeds, then train a convolutional 
neural network (CNN) to classify them by breed.

## Data

This project uses the following dog image dataset:
* [dog_images.zip](../master/dog_images.zip)
* The zip file above has to be unzipped into a folder called `images`.
